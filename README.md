# Data-Science-Project-5

I recently completed a project about Predicting Boston Housing Prices using machine learning algorithms. 

🔍 Key Highlights:
In this project, three different machine learning models were employed to predict housing prices in Boston. The models utilized were Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost. The evaluation of these models was performed using key performance metrics: R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

🎯 Project Objectives:
Which variables impact MEDV, and which predictive model performs the best in predicting MEDV values.
